## 1) Download Unity from https://unity3d.com/
## 2) Download the Android SDK from https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html and the JDK from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jsp-138363.html
## 3) Tell Unity where the Android SDK and JDK are located by going to Edit > Preferences > External Tools and filling in SDK and JDK with the paths to each respectively.  (Android folder is SDK2)
## 4) Change your build setting to build for Android by going to File > Build Settings clicking on Android and then Switch Platform.  
### 4.5) You will also need to add any scenes you want added to the build from this screen.  This will need to be done any time you add a new scene.
## 5) Download Unity Remote 5 from the app store
## 6) Enable Developer options on your phone by going to Settings > About Phone and tapping Build Number 7 times. 
## 7) Go back into Developer options and enable USB debugging
## 8) Plug phone into computer with Unity Remote Running and start the Unity debugger to test
### 8.5) I believe the phone needs to be plugged in before starting up unity or else the remote will not work.
